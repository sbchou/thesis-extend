"Clinton Allies Forming Group to Protect, Register Voters",clinton,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — Allies of Hillary Clinton are forming a new $25 million political organization aimed at expanding voter protection efforts and driving turnout and registration among Latino and black voters essential to her Democratic presidential campaign.

The new group, Every Citizen Counts, is beginning its work as Clinton faces a stronger-than-expected challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose overwhelming victory in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary has set off new worries among Democrats that Sanders may soon cut into Clinton's advantage with black and Hispanic voters.

The non-partisan organization will focus on legislation, litigation, voter registration and turnout among black and Latino communities in the general election. It was formed in August and has recently begun developing partnerships with other organizations to expand voter education, registration, protection and turnout.

Clinton has made voter registration and protection a major part of her agenda with minority voters and her campaign and is planning a significant push in the aftermath of her New Hampshire loss to win minority voters in the two remaining February contests in Nevada and South Carolina and a slew of Southern states holding contests in early March.

The group will operate as a nonprofit ""social welfare"" organization, allowing it to take unlimited donations and keep its donors' identities private. Organizers said it would not be involved in the Democratic primaries and would be focused on November's election and beyond.

Clinton said Tuesday night that both she and Sanders wanted to eliminate unaccounted money from politics. But the group's acceptance of private donations will likely draw scorn from Sanders and his allies, who have made the elimination of big, secret money in politics a pillar of his campaign.

During his victory speech in New Hampshire, Sanders said the Clinton team had already thrown everything but the kitchen sink at his — and warned, ""I have the feeling that kitchen sink is coming pretty soon as well.""

Every Citizen Counts will be advised by Guy Cecil, a former aide to Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign who currently leads Priorities USA Action, a Democratic super PAC supporting Clinton's bid. Cecil said he will continue in his current role as chief strategist at Priorities USA and other political work.

An early leader in the group will be Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, who has endorsed Clinton's campaign and will be a prominent supporter for her in Georgia's ""Super Tuesday"" primary on March 1.

Reed said in a statement that the organization would be a ""powerful ally to those who want to make registration and voting easier and fairer. This is at the heart of what it means to be an American.""

Sanders' allies will likely see the group's role differently. When Priorities USA announced its recent fundraising haul of $50 million through January, Sanders repeatedly told supporters that he had raised ""zero dollars"" for super PACs.

Every Citizen Counts is expected to have a budget of at least $25 million, according to a presentation given to potential donors. Among its goals will be expanding voting access in Georgia, Illinois, Missouri and Wisconsin.

The group already has a partnership with the National Democratic Voting Rights Trust, which has been involved in voting rights litigation in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Virginia and Ohio. The trust is advised by prominent campaign lawyer Marc Elias, who serves as general counsel for Clinton's presidential campaign.

Slides in a presentation provided to The Associated Press estimates that the group's litigation would protect the right to vote for 2 million voters in those four states, which will be among the most contested in the November election.

Cecil, who will serve as the organization's senior adviser, said he is putting together a team and advisory board that will oversee the group. He said the group was not aimed solely on the 2016 election but would be ""in this fight for the long haul.""

""There have been too many efforts to restrict access to the polls, making it even more difficult to vote,"" he said. ""We will engage at all levels: pushing for stronger legislation around early voting, same-day registration and vote by mail, waging legal battles to roll back onerous laws and registering voters in underrepresented communities across the country.""

The Latest: Clinton Vows ‘top-to-bottom review’ of Gov’t,clinton,"DERRY, N.H. (AP) — The Latest on the 2016 presidential campaign (all times local):

___

10:58 p.m.

Hillary Clinton is promising a “top-to-bottom review” of the government, vowing to “get rid of what doesn’t work.”

But she said during the Democratic presidential debate that she has no intention of eliminating entire government agencies, as some Republican presidential candidates are promising.

The key to making the government function better, Clinton says, is to allow voters to weigh in.",7.5,0
Cruz Looks to Shore Up Support Among Iowa Evangelicals,cruz,"WEST DES MOINES, Iowa — In Iowa, the evangelical vote can make or break a campaign — which is why both Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are battling over support from the most conservative voters, as the race heats up ahead of the state's leadoff caucus.

Cruz courted hundreds of social conservatives and evangelical voters who packed a Wednesday night rally, where he touted his anti-abortion beliefs while drawing sharp contrasts with Trump and his record on a variety of issues, including changing his position on abortion. Cruz also suggested that Trump doesn't have the humility or temperament to be president.

Winning evangelical voters — who catapulted underdog candidates to victory in Iowa in 2008 and 2012 — is essential for Cruz to do well when Iowans vote on Monday.

""If evangelical pastors move the pews to the caucuses, then Ted Cruz wins Iowa,"" said David Lane, an influential activist who has organized events across Iowa where Cruz and other Republican candidates have addressed pastors.

On Monday, Cruz addressed about 250 pastors in Cedar Rapids and Des Moines. He gave his own assessment of where he sees the race, should Trump prevail in Iowa.

""If Donald wins Iowa, he right now has a substantial lead in New Hampshire,"" Cruz told Iowa pastors at the closed-door meeting, a comment first reported by the Christian Broadcasting Network and confirmed by Lane. ""If he went on to win New Hampshire as well, there is a very good chance he could be unstoppable and be our nominee.""

A day later, Cruz offered a different view while speaking to reporters, downplaying the need to secure a win in Iowa.

""We are running a national campaign,"" Cruz said in Albia, Iowa. ""From the beginning we've said no state is a must win for us.""

Lane said Cruz needs to win Iowa to stop Trump, and to do that, his evangelical supporters must turn out come caucus day.

But Trump, the current national front-runner in most preference polls, is starting to show strength among evangelicals at the same time that other more establishment Republicans are also warming to his candidacy.

Trump has been appearing at Christian colleges, including a convocation speech at Liberty University, one of the country's most prominent evangelical Christian institutions, last week. He received a glowing introduction from Jerry Falwell Jr., president of the school, who formally endorsed Trump on Tuesday. On Saturday, Trump was joined on the campaign trail by the Rev. Robert Jeffress of First Baptist Dallas, a megachurch.

Trump also paid a visit to church on Sunday, which his team invited a handful of journalists to document.

Asked why he was making gains with evangelicals, Trump said at a news conference Tuesday in Marshalltown, Iowa, it was because voters ""understand I'm a Christian. I'm a good Christian.""

On several occasions, Trump has flashed a copy of the Bible and a photo of his confirmation at events as proof of his piety.

Cruz, meanwhile, has worked diligently to line up support from pastors in all 99 Iowa counties. He secured the backing of James Dobson, former leader of the conservative Christian organization Focus on the Family, who campaigned with him in Iowa earlier this month. This week, he won the endorsement of Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian lobbying group in Washington. Perkins, along with former Texas Gov. Rick Perry who framed his two failed presidential bids on an effort to assert more conservative values, joined Cruz at Wednesday's rally that attracted hundreds of people in an overflowing event hall.

Bob Vander Plaats, a well-known leader among Christian conservatives in Iowa, also endorsed Cruz, and has been tapping his vast network of evangelicals for support while campaigning alongside the candidate.

Trump lashed out at Vander Plaats on Tuesday via Twitter, calling him a ""phony"" and a ""bad guy."" Vander Plaats assailed Trump at Wednesday's rally for the second time in as many days, saying the former reality TV star doesn't hold true conservative values.

""The sanctity of human life is not up for the art of the deal,"" Vander Plaats said, referring to the title of Trump's book, ""The Art of the Deal.""

Cruz tried to cast the interplay as an example of Trump's inability to grasp the needs of true conservative voters.

""When you start vilifying and demonizing and attacking strong conservative leaders because they choose not to support you, that starts to communicate an awful lot to the men and women who are watching,"" Cruz said in Ottumwa, Iowa, on Tuesday.

A political action committee backing Cruz has also gone after Trump with a similar theme, this week launching a $2.5 million television ad buy in both Iowa and South Carolina.

""Donald Trump is not a conservative,"" one of the ads charges before looping in archival footage of the billionaire businessman from 1999, declaring: ""I am pro-choice in every respect.""

Trump says he has since changed his position and opposes abortion rights.

Trump's campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement Wednesday that he is now ""pro-life"" and that his ""core conservative values are unwavering."" She highlighted Falwell's endorsement, as well as that of conservative firebrand Sarah Palin and Phyllis Schlafly, a longtime conservative activist who backed Cruz's 2012 Senate run. ",11.8,1
The Latest: Bible prominent in Final Cruz Pitches to Voters,cruz,"The Latest on the 2016 race for president on the final weekend of campaigning before Monday's leadoff Iowa caucuses (all times local):

5 p.m.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is infusing his closing argument to Iowans with Biblical references as his campaign visits some of the state's conservative strongholds.

Cruz has made courting Iowa's evangelical Christians a cornerstone of his campaign and he has long tapped the Bible in his stump speech.

At a stop Saturday at Darrell's Place in Hamlin, Iowa, Cruz urged his supporters to ""awaken the body of Christ that we may pull back from the abyss.""

The line drew loud cheers from the western Iowa crowd.",7.9,0
"Sanders tours Roosevelt site, says Bation can learn from FDR",sanders,"HYDE PARK, N.Y. — Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said Tuesday the nation can learn from President Franklin D. Roosevelt's courageous stance against powerful interests, drawing parallels to his own fight against the ""billionaire class.""

Sanders toured the grounds of Roosevelt's home and presidential library along the Hudson River, pausing to pay his respects at the gravesites of the late president and his first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt. The impromptu visit ahead of New York's presidential primary offered symbolic meaning for a candidate who casts himself as the counterweight to Wall Street and establishment politics.

""I think there is a lot that we can learn today from Roosevelt's life and courage, from his willingness to stand up to the most powerful special interests of his time — people he called the economic royalists, people I call the billionaire class today,"" Sanders said.

""In 1936, when he was re-nominated by the Democratic Party for another term as president, he proudly proclaimed that he welcomed the hatred of the economic royalists — that he stood with the working class and the oppressed people of this country. And that's what he did,"" Sanders said.

Sanders has frequently expressed his admiration for Roosevelt as he challenges Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. In a speech last year, he sought to connect his own views of ""democratic socialism"" to Roosevelt's push for economic security, a living wage and universal health care.

Later, at a rally at Marist College in nearby Poughkeepsie, Sanders praised Roosevelt's 1944 ""Second Bill of Rights,"" which asserted that Americans should have the right to a job with a living wage, health care, education and economic protections for the elderly.

""Roosevelt was right back in 1944 and we still have not achieved that goal,"" Sanders said.",14.1,1
The Latest: Sanders says Trump campaign based on division,sanders,"The latest developments in the 2016 presidential campaign (all times EST):

8 p.m.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is accusing Donald Trump of running a campaign based on demagoguery and division, a strategy Sanders says has been used for decades to pit Americans against each other.

Sanders says, ""That's the oldest trick in the book — he didn't invent it.""

He says Trump's rhetoric on Muslims and immigrants is designed to ""create a nation of hatred.""

Sanders says turning Americans against each other only makes the rich richer while ordinary people are ""fighting with each other for the crumbs.""

The Democratic candidate was speaking to a raucous crowd of nearly 1,000 people in New Hampshire.",8,0
Trump not backing down from Fox debate boycott,trump,"IOWA CITY, Iowa — Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump isn't backing down Wednesday from his threat to boycott this week's GOP debate, where candidates have the opportunity to make their closing arguments before voting begins in Monday's Iowa caucuses.

Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said in a pair of television interviews Wednesday that Trump, a billionaire businessman, ""knows when to walk away from a bad deal.""

""They think they can toy with Mr. Trump,"" Lewandowski said of Fox News on MSNBC's Morning Joe. ""Mr. Trump doesn't play games.""

The decision comes after a showdown between the network and GOP candidate over who should moderate Thursday night's debate. Trump has been in a feud with Fox News host and scheduled debate moderator Megyn Kelly since the first Republican primary debate, when Kelly took Trump to task over derogatory statements he'd made in the past aimed at women.

While Trump has threatened to skip debates in the past and not gone through with the threat, a sarcastic statement from Fox appeared to push him over the edge.
That statement said the leaders of Iran and Russia ""both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president"" and that ""Trump has his own secret plan to replace the Cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings.""

Trump, who has called Kelly a ""lightweight"" and biased, told reporters at an Iowa press conference Wednesday night that he would be holding a fundraising event in Iowa at the same time as the debate to benefit veterans and wounded soldiers instead.
While Fox questioned how ""Iowans are going to feel about him walking away from them at the last minute,"" Lewandowski said the decision shows Trump is a leader who ""understands when a bad deal is in front of him and is ready to walk away from a bad deal, something that this country should be able to do.""
""At the end of the day,"" he added on MSNBC, ""Mr. Trump is going to have the last laugh.""

FACT CHECK: Audio refutes Trump's claim on China tariff,trump,"WASHINGTON — New audio released by The New York Times refutes Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's claim that he never called for a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports during a recent editorial board meeting with the paper.

Trump, during Thursday night's debate, denied having called for the 45 percent tariff if he's elected president.

""That's wrong. They were wrong,"" he said during the debate, which was hosted by Fox Business Network. ""It's the New York Times,"" he added. ""They are always wrong.""

He later said: ""I'm totally open to a tariff. If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed. You can't deal in China without tariffs. They do it to us, we don't it. It's not fair trade.""

THE FACTS: An audio clip from the meeting posted by the paper contradicts the billionaire businessman and GOP candidate.

""I would tax China coming in, products coming in,"" Trump is heard saying. ""I would do a tariff and they do it to us. We have to be smart.""

""I'm a free trader. I love free trade, but it's got to be reasonably fair,"" he adds. ""I would do a tax, and the tax — let me tell you what the tax should be: The tax should be 45 percent. That would be a tax that would be an equivalent to some of the kind of, you know, devaluations that they've done. They cannot believe that we haven't done this yet.""

Trump has also called for penalties on companies, such as auto manufacturers, that shift manufacturing overseas.",5.8,0
